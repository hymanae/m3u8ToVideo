# m3u8ToVideo
it converts m3u8 formate multiple (video) files to unknown formate single video file.

### currently outfile file formate is unknown. but still this file is supported by many video players.

## Supported Video Players :
1. Mi Video (android)
2. Movies and Tv (win 10)
3. Windows Media Player
4. UC Video (android)

### notes :
* if video is downloaded from UC Browser sometimes it downloaded in m3u8 formate (indexfile.m3u8 and contentsfolder.m3u8_contents) for that it is useful to convert that into single video file.
* sometime while trying to download video from browser it gives simply a text file, for that give text file as indexfile and give folder as "#\<internet\>" so that m3u8tovideo can download all splits and make that into single video file but it takes some time.
* by using video convertors the video can be changed to known formate so that it can be played using any video players.
